## About the company

Maven Toys is a dynamic and forward-thinking toy company that transcends the boundaries of traditional play. Maven Toys believes in the power of play to not only entertain but to ignite ingenuity and spark creativity. As a leading force in the toy industry, they are on a mission to create joyous moments that go beyond the ordinary.

Their commitment to excellence extends from the imaginative products that define their brand to the meticulous analysis of data driving their strategic expansion. Maven Toys is not just a company; itâ€™s a celebration of the boundless potential of play, where each moment becomes a canvas for imagination, and each toy is a key to unlocking new realms of creativity.


## Project brief

At Maven Toys, we understand that every childâ€™s smile is a testament to the joy encapsulated within our products. Now, with a strategic vision to extend this joy to even more families, we have therefore initiated a comprehensive data-driven analysis.

In this project, I will be assuming the role of a BI consultant who has just been hired by Maven Toys. As they look to expand their business with new stores, theyâ€™ve brought me in to analyze interesting patterns and trends in their data and help them make informed decisions.
